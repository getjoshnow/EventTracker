### Welcome
Hello, welcome to my Life tracker App.  This app is designed to tracker the everyday errands and task that need to get done.  There are many TODO apps out there that never seem to have depth and complexity.  Life tracker is that solution where you can input individual tasks and sort based off of priority and category.

### Overview
This program is designed to gather the users individual tasks (Life Event).    
The application prompts the user to enter forum data to be stored in the data base.  This information can then be retrieved using lifeEvent IDs.   There is an option to select all events and display them in a table.
Thank you for using this application.

###Life Event Tracker Application
Week 13 homework for Skill Distillery Java bootcamp. Life Event Tracker Application is a database designed for the user to view, sort, modify and add files through a dynamic website.  The website stores all information in Amazon Web Services on a private port and retrieve data on demand.  The user can then sort data and retrieve whats needed.


###Technologies Used
Java
JavaScript
Eclipse -Plugin
Spring Tools Suite
Atom
MS Visual Studio
GitHub
Terminal
MySQL Workbench
Postman
MAMP
Chrome Developer


###Lessons Learned
Life tracker taught me mostly backend design inorder to bring a list of features to the front end.  As in Object Oriented programming, I approached MySql & Javascript and used each ccording to their intended design.  MySql has built in sorting and math functions that I could then use to sort my data sccording.  I used javascript to build dynamic tables inorder to take advantage of MySql features. This approach enpowered to create a more dynamic, Web 2.0 approach to website design.  This approach gave me a strong  solid foundation was initially challenge, but ultimately a very useful way of building my application.   This was truly a fun challenge, and I hope you enjoy my program.

###Attack Plan
Building upon database design, my first approach was to find the most dynamic way the data could be retireved and sorted in MySql.  Identify the tables and classes needed was my primary focus before I even begin coding.  Using many application, I knew a checklist of design features would be needed to ensure I stayed on task and was consistent accross platforms.   Ensuring functionality and formatting were utmost priority, and once I have a good minimal viable program, I then branched out into my stretch goals of developing a more user friendly frontend mouse centered design. In this weekend sprint, I was able to build a wireframe and working database within day 1 that meet all the requirements and functionality.  From there, I focus on making the application more useful, and user friendly.  I sought to make it mobile friendly as my ultimate goal was to build this application to be a quick but frequent use.   

###Wish List Additions
My wish list, are to take advantage of touch interface of swipping left or right between Life Event task.  I believe mobile is the future and build applications that are mobile frienly will go along way to ensure multiplatform use.  Currently, I am satisfied with my mouse driven design and I wish I had more time to test and try the product so I can improve the user experience.
